# OpenVPN for Puppet

Puppet module for OpenVPN.

## Differences to other implementations

* `luxflux-openvpn` (https://github.com/luxflux/puppet-openvpn)[https://github.com/luxflux/puppet-openvpn]
  `luxflux-openvpn` is a full-fledged implementation that includes key/cert-generation and handling. If you want that, I highly recommend this module. If you want to manage keys/certs differently and only let puppet install OpenVPN without taking over secrets management, then use this module instead.
